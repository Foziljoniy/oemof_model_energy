no, I have done project and I uploaded to github and now create read.me file for me https://github.com/oemof/oemof-visio link and these are files in a.ipynb and prof energy.ipynb and yntitled 7ipnb, thereese are file mainly my prof enrgy and untitled 7 is main one, also for running oemof model write links and main requiresemsts like cbc and other. For oeomof model requirements use this link https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph also glpk
